<!-- 				<p class="p">Hello there! I've recently moved back to the states after 3 wonderful years of living in the Netherlands. Originally from the Chicago suburbs, I went to school in Champaign Urbana to study Art History. After graduting in 2010 I started volunteering at the university's art museum, Krannert and became the Office Manager of a local <a class="link" href="commonground.coop" target="_blank">food co-op</a> . While there I was the tech help-desk for store operations, managed payroll, bookkeeping and hired and managed one employee. Since before college I also had sales experience in the retail sector I stepped up to lead our Owner Loan Campaign to help expand the current store's location to double in size. As Campaign Manager we had an initial goal of $800K and together with a team of volunteers and informative staff members we were able to raise it in under 2 months. When quotes and owner demand grew we found out we needed an additional $200K we achieved it in another month. With $1 million raised and secured in the bank we were able to start and finish construction. I left the co-op to become the assistant manager at a store turning a once worst in district to the top third out of over 30 stores. When a neighboring store was looking for a new store manager I jumped on the opportunity to advance and led a staff of 10 employees to exceed our goals by 110% in under my first 3 months there.  </p>
